        <li>
          North eastern region is expected to be highly prone to consequences of
          climate change due to its geo-ecological fragility.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several evidences to suggest that there is already the
          beginning of climate change process which is reflected in erratic
          weather, abrupt rising temperature, deficiency in rainfall, humidity
          variation and increase unpredictability of weather.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of hot days and hot nights show an increasing trend while
          that of cold days and cold nights shows declining trend in Meghalaya.
        </li>
        <li>
          The changing climate in Meghalaya would have wide spread implication
          for agriculture, water resources, forest, biodiversity human and
          animal health.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the state where agriculture is a predominantly rain fed and
          variation and unpredictability leading to farmers insecurity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meghalaya State Council on Climate Change & Sustainable Deployment as
          well as a Steering Committee have been constituted to coordinate State
          Action Plan for assessment, adaption and mitigation of Climate Change.
        </li>
        <li>
          State Action Plan on Climate Change has been approved by MOEF & CC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Forests are the sink for carbon dioxide and plays important role in
          mitigating global warming.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of the goals of the Forest Department is to mitigate the impact of
          global warming and to ensure the stability of the fragile eco-system
          by protecting and maintaining forest and tree cover in the State.
        </li>
        <li>
          The State has progressed towards securing and protecting community
          forests and sacred groves by notifying into Community reserves under
          the Provisions of Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972 which will help ij
          mitigating impact of global warming.
        </li>
        <li>
          People and local traditional institutions are increasingly involved in
          protection and management of their forests through mechanism of Joint
          Forest Management.
