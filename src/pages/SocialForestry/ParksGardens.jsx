      <h4>THANGKHARANG PARK</h4>
      <p>
        Thangkharang, a small hamlet in the southern aspect of Sohra
        (Cherrapunjee), East Khasi Hills District is located at a distance of
        about 66 Kms away (by road) from Shillong. During the Pre - Independence
        period, Khasi traders who were trading with erstwhile East Pakistan (now
        Bangladesh) used this place as night halt. During their halt, they
        usually lit a campfire and smoked the fishes brought from East Pakistan
        ("Thang" means smoke or burn and kharang means smoked fish). Hence, the
        place is called "Thang-kharang".
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forest Department through Social Forestry Division East Khasi Hills
        during the year 1992-93 took initiative by consulting the local Sirdar,
        headmen and village elders of MawsmaiElaka to spare the forest land on
        the western end of the village and develop it as a recreational park.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary objective was to protect and maintain the natural landscape
        and to develop and preserve its scenic beauty. The Department and the
        Elaka signed the agreement on{' '}
        <strong>29th June 1993. The Department took over 5.5 hectares</strong>{' '}
        of land from the Elaka. After three years of development, the park was
        inaugurated and opened to public on
        <strong>29th June 1996</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department established the Park as an Environmental - cum
        Recreational Centre to create awareness among the visitors on importance
        of Forests and Environment and need for its conservation - and more
        importantly to imbibe in their mind that " Nothing is redundant in
        Nature".

        submits the revenue report including the number of visitors every month.
