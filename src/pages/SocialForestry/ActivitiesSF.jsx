        Implementation of Social Forestry Programme in the State of Meghalaya
        started during the year 1981 with the creation of a separate Social
        Forestry Circle. The main task of the Social Forestry Circle was to
        carry out afforestation programme in the areas outside the Government
        Control Forest areas which include the Reserved Forests, Protected
        Forests, Wild-life Sanctuaries and National Parks. The task of the
        Social Forestry Circle was therefore, to afforest the degraded areas
        falling outside the jurisdiction of the State Forest Department. This
        was achieved by negotiating with the Land owners, consisting of private
        individuals, Clan members and Community members to arrive at a
        consensus, execution of an agreement and followed by the actual
        afforestation of the area. Therefore, it can be said that the concept of
        Joint Forest Management was started in Meghalaya right from the
        inception of the Social Forestry Circle though the same was not
        officially called as the JFM. The wing is also set to play an important
        role in other environmental matters of concern for the state including
        reclamation of sites affected by human activities.The afforestation
        programmes with participation of private sectors undertaken by the
        Social Forestry Wing of the Department include Schemes sanctioned under
        State Plan and Compensatory Afforestation or CAMPA being implemented in
        the entire state.

        The Govt. of Meghalaya renamed the 'Forest Department' as the 'Forest &
        Environment Department' in the year 1991 and transferred Environment
        Planning Cell from Urban Affairs Department on 15th March, 1991. It was
        subsequently again renamed in 2014 as 'Department of Forest &
        Environment & Climate Change'. In the year 2015, the administrative
        control of the State Pollution Control Board was transferred to this
        Department. In August 2015, the Govt. of Meghalaya has notified the o/o
        the Addl. PCCF (SF & E) as the secretariat of the newly re-constituted
        SEIAA (State Environment Impact Assessment Authority) and also made the
        CCF (SF & E) as its ex-officio Member Secretary. Currently, the staff of
        'Environment Cell' has been assisting the SEIAA, in addition to other
        duties.

        The Social Forestry & Environment Wing concentrated its effort on
        raising forest nursery, roadside plantation, block plantation on
        community and private land with an objective to ameliorate environmental
        degradations. Thus to a great extent such afforestation measures helped
        to maintain overall satisfactory forest cover for the State as may be
        seen in the India State of Forest Report.
