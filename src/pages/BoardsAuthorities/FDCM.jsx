      <h4>Present Function and Activities of the FDCM Ltd.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Timber Trading Business:</strong> At present the main
          functions and activities of the FDCM is timber trading business in
          which revenue is ploughed back to disbursed the pay of staff and
          meeting other exigencies viz maintenance of office and plantations.
          The timbers are procured from the following sources:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Timber allotted by Government:</strong> Yearly the
              Government earmarks wind fallen trees and unclaimed seized timbers
              lying in various Ranges and Beat Office under the Territorial
              Division. The above timbers, some of which are lying scattered
              inside the Government Reserved Forest areas and some stacked
              inside the depot are allotted to the FDCM Ltd. These timbers in
              advance are prepared into lots by the Range Forest Officer along
              with its valuation and submitted to the Divisional Forest Officer,
              who in turn forwards it to Principal Chief Conservator of Forests.
              The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, through approval from
              Government offer the timber to FDCM on condition that the timber
              is paid its royalty before lifting. However before the FDCM pays
              the royalty, an officer is sent to inspect the timber and when
              satisfied about its physical condition, the royalty is deposited
              to the Divisional Forest Officer simultaneously requesting him for
              issue of lifting order. The above timbers are either transferred
              to the FDCM licensed saw mill at Darugiri or Nongpoh for
              conversion to sawn timber or sold at site to timber contractors
              through auction or direct negotiation at some profitable price
              above the royalty rate. Timbers brought to the saw mill are
              disposed off in sawn form from the mill site and through retail
              outlets. At present the FDCM is being allotted timbers from Garo
              Hills (T) Division only which consisted mostly of Teak & Sal.

            <li>
              <strong>Sale of Timber through Railway Containers:</strong>{' '}
              Consequent upon the Supreme Court's banned on the export of timber
              from North Eastern State to other parts of India during 1995-96
              via road transport, the price of timber has fallen down
              drastically. To overcome this setback the Government of India
              devised an alternative for disposal of timbers by rails i.e. by
              means of transportation through railway containers. These railway
              containers are allotted to each North Eastern State whose
              activities are monitored by the Special Investigation Team from
              Delhi, which came into with effect from April 2007. Since then the
              containers are allotted quarterly to all the states. So far the
              FDCM has containers allotted for two quarters only i.e. during
              July to September 2007 14 (fourteen) containers and during March
              2008 38 (Thirty Eight) containers. Unfortunately during the last
              10 years not a single container was allotted to FDCM Ltd.

              Supervisory works for the operation of pine and non sal trees
              under approved working scheme:
            </strong>{' '}
            On assuming the role of State Agency w.e.f January 2007 the FDCM
            Ltd. commenced its function where it is involved in the supervisory
            works for the operation of pine and non sal trees under Approved
            Working Scheme in Jaintia Hills only. Lately the FDCM Ltd. receives
            commission from Working Scheme areas in Jaintia Hills only.
          </p>
          <p>
            The marking of trees in the registered private forest areas under
            Approved Working Scheme is carried out by the Forest Officer of the
            District Council in the presence of an Officer of the State Forest
            Department. After marking of the trees are completed for each forest
            the lists are then submitted and placed before the Monitoring
            Committee who after scrutiny approves it. Thereafter upon its
            approval the trees are felled and sectioned by the FDCM acting as a
            State Agency for the operation. Usually the operation is carried out
            by the Registered Forest Operator and the staff of FDCM supervises
            the works. Normally the Forest operator who is also purchasing the
            timbers from the Private Forest owners is oblige to pay to the FDCM
            by way of Commission for supervisory works at a fixed rate per cubic
            meter. In this way some amount is also earned by the Corporation to
            add to its revenue collection.

            <strong>Sawmill Project:</strong> The FDCM Ltd. is also involved in
            the management and operations of two licensed sawmill at Nongpoh,
            Ri-Bhoi District and Darugiri, East Garo Hills. Conversion/sawing in
            these mills are carried out only for legal timbers from legal
            sources delivered under cover of valid transit passes (from the
            State Forest Department/District Council) unfortunately the revenue
            generated from these mills are irregular with negligible
            contribution .

            <strong>Bamboo Treatment Plant Project:</strong> Recently the FDCM
            Ltd. is also privileged to avail the facility of setting up of a
            Vacuum Pressure Bamboo Treatment Plant at Nongpoh sawmill as a
            Technology demonstration initiated by the National Mission on Bamboo
            Applications, Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India.
            Commissioning/operation of the plant is already completed. The main
            purpose of the plant is for chemical treatment of Bamboo having
            various utility. After commissioning the plant is presently
            projected to receive (approx) 30,000 bamboo culms. The pressure
            treatment facility being the first such unit to be established in
            the State and with the increasing demand of treated bamboo in the
            market, is expected to enhance and generate more revenue urgently
            required to sustain the earnings of the Corporation.

            still carried out till date.
