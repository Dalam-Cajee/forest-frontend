        The State Board for Wildlife is constituted as per Section 6 of the Wild
        Life Protection Act, 1972 as amended in 2013. The State Board for
        Wildlife chaired by the Chief Minister, is the highest body in the State
        for making policy decisions on Wildlife conservation, which gives
        direction to the functioning of the Wildlife wing. The Minister
        in-charge of Forests is the Vice-Chairperson while the Chief Wildlife
        Warden is the Member-Secretary of the Board.
      </p>
      <h5>
        <u>Functions of the Woldlife Wing:-</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The wing is charged with the task of implementing the Wild Life
        (Protection) Act 1972. The main strategies aimed to be achieved are as
        follows: -
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          To provide for long term ecological security of the State by
          identifying, protecting and conserving the basic nature of floral and
          faunal ecosystems and to restore degraded areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protection and Management of National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries and
          Community Reserves of the State
        </li>
        <li>
          To sensitize local communities on conservation issues through
          awareness programmes and involving them in conservation efforts
          through formation of Community Reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protection and Conservation of Wildlife and its Habitat outside
          Protected Areas on participatory mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          To enhance economic development strategies in fringe villages for
          their socio-economic upliftment and to reduce their dependency on the
          Protected Areas(PAs) and wildlife habitats.
        </li>
        <li>To reduce man-animal conflict and rescuing of Wild animals.</li>
        <li>
          To ensure effective control of poaching and illegal trade of wildlife
          products
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        All management activities in the Protected Areas are carried out in
        accordance with prescriptions of site specific management plans which
        adopt an ecosystem approach to management, except in certain cases where
        species oriented approach is required e.g. Project Elephant. The annual
        plan of operations of each of the Protected Areas are based on the
        respective management plans, which are a mixture of scientific
        prescriptions, focusing on conservation needs, habitat needs and
        ecological concerns of the area. Plan objectives include the development
        of people living in the fringe areas so as to reduce their dependence on
        the core areas and securing their co-operation in the management of
        these Protected Areas.
      </p>
      <h4>Conservation Awareness and Education</h4>
      <p>
        Awareness and educative programmes are taken up on a continuous basis in
        appropriate areas. The implication of Wildlife Acts & Rules and
        conservation issues in local languages are published. Every year,
        programmes are held, involving all levels of schools and colleges, in
        various activities acquainting them with conservations issues and
        obtaining feedback and opinions to gauge the thinking of the young
        generation and to impart awareness for nature conservation. These
        activities culminate in Wildlife Week celebrations during the first week
        of October. Lectures and discussions are also held in villages around
        PAs and other managed areas, on issues of mutual interest. The State has
        two mini Zoos at Shillong and Tura and a recreational park at Umiam
        which are being managed with the objective of creating appreciation and
        concern for nature and wildlife conservation.
      </p>
      <h4>Protection and Law enforcement</h4>
      <p>
        There is a constant demand for wildlife products from these areas and
        other parts of the country, in the neighbouring South East Asian
        Countries. Shillong is an important transit point for these illegal
        trade in wildlife products. The traditional practices of community
        hunting and meat eating habit of the people in and around this state
        puts the wildlife of the state (which are mostly located in the vast
        habitats outside government control) in constant danger. Wildlife
        protection is therefore a priority area. Notable achievements are the
        eradication of community hunting in and around the Nongkhyllem Wildlife
        Sanctuary and closure of illegal sale of rare species of butterflies of
        the State - on orders of the High Court. With the help of the police and
        custom department, considerable seizures had been made of elephant and
        tiger products.
      </p>
      <h4>Development of Protected Areas(PAs)</h4>
      <p>
        These activities include works like weed eradication, maintenance of
        water holes and salt licks, improvement of wetlands and fire protection
        which are done as part of habitat ameliorative measures to contain the
        wildlife population in the PAs. Patrolling camps are constructed to
        facilitate proper protection to wildlife. Development of local village
        communities through Eco-development works is also an integral part of
        wildlife management. Villages identified for eco-development are those
        where the people's activities have a bearing on the PAs. These measures
        are aimed at socio economic up-liftment and includes works like raising
        of horticultural plantations, fuel wood and fodder plantations,
        Non-Timber Forest Product, nursery, supply of handlooms, bee hive boxes,
        providing water supply to the villages and equipment to schools such as
        benches and blackboard, fishery ponds etc. The types of activities taken
        up depend upon the needs, requirement, skills and living habit of the
        people involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other activities proposed in the newly constituted elephant reserves are
        habitat improvement for providing food and shelter to animals in
        degraded habitats and protection measures in the form of patrolling
        camps along important routes and corridors.
